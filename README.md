# UFOs
The purpose of this challenge was to create more filters for Dana's webpage, the dynamic table is working as intended, and Dana would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. Then change has allowed the user to filter for multiple criteria. 
## Results
The final webpage is shown below with examples listed in the fields.

## Summary
There is a drawback to this design, and it is the way the fields are displayed.
Recommendation:
- Add a dropdown arrow for each field. This might make it easier for the user to choose, instead of typing into a field to filter their data.
- Adding a clear button would also help so the user can start from the beginning in their search.
